Formal Verification of Flexibility in Swarm Robotics
=====

Microscopic v.s. macroscopic
approach to model checking
swarm robotics.

"The first approach consists of building a model by first creating a corresponding
finite state machine for each robot behavior and then by taking the composition of
all those finite state machines. The second approach consists of building a single
finite state machine containing a state for each different sub-behavior of the robots.
Each state is associated with a counter that keep track of the number of robot
currently in that state."
